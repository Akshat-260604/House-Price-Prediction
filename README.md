The House-Price-Prediction is my first practical Machine Learning project where I have tried to implement Machine Learning techniques like Linear Regression and Random Forest Model. 
The dataset is of California houses that is taken from Kaggle.
The model was able to achieve to 67% accuracy on Linear Regression Model but it achieved 82.19% on Random Forest Model.
After using standard scaler on random forest regression, the accuracy increased slightly to 82.41%.
I took help from NeuralNine to complete this project.
